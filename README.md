# reddit-react
A reddit web client.

## Setup

How to set up the application locally for development.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools on your machine:

- *[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) as a global user (`npm i -g concurrently`)

\* I actually recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), and then running the command `nvm i stable`. Much easier, and allows you to switch between Node versions later.

### Initialization

In the project directory, run the init script:

    $ npm i

### Running & Viewing

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Run the following command:

    $ npm start

Default port for local is `3000`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the application running.
